# Turbo Pascal 7.0 Units

I just coded these units to speed up my development for DOS challenges in Turbo Pascal.
These units are solely meant for Turbo Pascal 7.0
Although I cannot rule out the possibility some of them are compatible with Free Pascal or Delphi, they were not written for those compilers, and I therefore recommend not to use this code for these compilers.
